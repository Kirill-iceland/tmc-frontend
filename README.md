# Technical Minecraft Wiki Frontend 
![book](book.png)
### Purpose

Our initiative for building a wiki for the community is to organize everyone's knowledge into one
    place that is
    accessible and quick to reference. Getting started with technical
    minecraft can be confusing and complicated, but the wiki can help those who
    are new to enter the community. Now that there is a place to store everyone's
    knowledge it also makes it easier and more transparent for large scale projects
    across versions.

### Contribute

There are many ways that you can contribute to the project. The project is still getting off the
    ground, and we
    are looking for people to help fill posts on the wiki. The project as of right now is fairly simple,
    but as it
    goes on it could get more complicated, and we are looking for people to help use build. Please consider
    making issues with features that  you would like to see, or sending in pull requests and doing it
    yourself. Currently only myself and @LinoBigatti are working on this project, and we appreciate
    all the help we can get.

## [The Backend API]((https://github.com/LinoBigatti/tmc-wiki-backend))

The project space for this is too large to fit in one reposoirty and one code base, so we split
it into two. The Backend API is what drives the site and what handels everything. 
@LinoBigatti manages and runs the [API repo](https://github.com/LinoBigatti/tmc-wiki-backend).
